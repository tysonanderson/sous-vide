# Sous Vide for Hackers

Here you can find the class materials for the sous vide class taught at SYN Shop.

The file used to cut the enclosure file on the laser cutter can be found [here.](https://raw.github.com/tysonanderson/sous-vide/master/sous_vide_enclosure.svg) The material used for this box was 1/4 inch plywood. If you would like to use a different material you can use [boxmaker](http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/) to create a new box and then copy over the remaining shapes from the current box file.

The parts list can be found [here.](https://github.com/tysonanderson/sous-vide/blob/master/sous_vide_part_list.csv)ocks.org/mbostock).

The presentation can be found [here.](http://tysonanderson.github.io/sous-vide/)
